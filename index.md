##My projects in Python 3

###Currently there are 3 files in Python available:

1. photos_chronologically.py : The script allows you to sort photos according to the time and date the file was created and rename them to a unified one. This can be helpful when you want to display photos collected from various devices on a smartTV using a USB flash drive.

2. header_reader.py : The script uses Selenium Webdriver and reads headers from selected websites, it can also search for them by keywords. The script is still being expanded with new functionalities.

3. factorial_3_ways.py : The script computes the factorial value for a given number in 3 ways: using the 'math' module, computing iteratively and computing recursively.
