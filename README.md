My projects in Python 3

* photos_chronologically.py :
The script allows you to sort photos according to the time and date the file was created and rename them to a unified one.
This can be helpful when you want to display photos collected from various devices on a smartTV using a USB flash drive.

* header_reader.py :
The script uses Selenium Webdriver and reads headers from selected websites, it can also search for them by keywords. 
The script is still being expanded with new functionalities.

* factorial_3_ways.py :
The script computes the factorial value for a given number in 3 ways: using the 'math' module, computing iteratively and computing recursively.

* Covid-19_API.py :
The script allows you to check the total number of cases, deaths and active cases of Covid-19 in the world in general and in Poland. The script uses a free API to collect data. Own API key is needed (https://rapidapi.com/ for registration).
